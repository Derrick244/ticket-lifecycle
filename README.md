<p>
Ticket Creation/Submission: This is the first stage, where an issue or request is logged into the system by the user or automatically via integrations (like monitoring systems or email). A ticket will typically include a description of the issue, priority, and any relevant details.

Ticket Assignment & Investigation: After the ticket is created, it is assigned to the appropriate team or individual who will investigate and work on resolving the issue. During this stage, the team may ask for more details, perform troubleshooting, or begin addressing the problem. Itâ€™s an active phase where resolution efforts are being put into play.

<p>
Ticket Resolution & Closure: Once the issue is resolved, the ticket moves to the closure stage. The team will mark the ticket as resolved, ensuring that all necessary actions have been taken. The ticket is then closed, and sometimes feedback or confirmation from the user is requested to ensure satisfaction before final closure.
